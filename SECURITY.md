### GitGuardian Alert - Google API Key Exposure

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Issue**: Google API Key was exposed in the repository  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### What Happened

A Google API key was accidentally committed to the repository in the `.env` file. This key has been:

1. ‚úÖ **Removed** from the repository
2. ‚úÖ **Added to .gitignore** to prevent future exposure  
3. ‚úÖ **Repository cleaned** of sensitive data

### What You Need to Do

If you cloned this repository before the fix, please:

1. **Delete your local copy** and re-clone:
   ```bash
   rm -rf Navi
   git clone https://github.com/bjornshomelab/Navi.git
   ```

2. **Regenerate your Google API key** (if you used the exposed one):
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Delete the old key and create a new one

3. **Follow secure setup**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your own keys
   ```

### Security Measures Implemented

- ‚úÖ `.env` file removed from git tracking
- ‚úÖ `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` provided as secure template
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated with security best practices
- ‚úÖ Repository history cleaned

### Prevention

To prevent this in the future:

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - they should only contain local configuration
2. **Use `.env.example`** - template files with placeholder values
3. **Check `.gitignore`** - ensure sensitive files are excluded
4. **Use `git status`** - review what you're committing

### Security Best Practices

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - Use environment variables
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# ‚úÖ Good - Use .env file (not committed)
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env

# ‚ùå Bad - Never commit real keys
git add .env  # DON'T DO THIS
```
